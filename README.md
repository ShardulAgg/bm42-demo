# BM42 Qdrant Search Demo

This demo project is designed to test and showcase the capabilities of the bm42 searching model integrated with Qdrant vector database. It provides a practical implementation to demonstrate how the bm42 model can be utilized for efficient and accurate vector search operations.

The demo consists of a React frontend for user interaction and visualization, coupled with a FastAPI backend that interfaces with the Qdrant database and the bm42 model. This setup allows users to:

1. Input search queries
2. Observe the bm42 model's processing of these queries
3. View the search results retrieved from the Qdrant database
4. Analyze the performance and accuracy of the bm42 searching model

By exploring this demo, users can gain insights into the strengths and potential applications of the bm42 model in conjunction with Qdrant for various search and retrieval tasks.
